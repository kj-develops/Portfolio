        <p>I have worked at UiT the Arctic University of Norway for several years in student counselling and at the university 
            library. Last as a leader of the library of psychology and law. I have been working with digitalization, improvement and been a 
            super user in several software systems (digital exams, request tracker, library search software)

        <p>I spent almost 2 years in Brønnøysund working as a guality coordinator and project leader. I was certified in ITIL and took a quality 
            leadership class focused on ISO-9000 in this period.
